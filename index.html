          <h2>About</h2>
          <p class="lead">The Raspberry Pi RFID Scanner is a project that seeks to create a new system for taking attendance in a school or workplace enviornment</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set-up and Go! After the initial setup, the scanner requires little user interaction!</li>
            <li>Low Overhead! This system is budget friendly to implement!</li>
            <li>Simplify Your Attendance! By removing a user, the Raspberry pi RFID Scanner will make taking attendance much simpler!</li>

          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p class="lead">The design process for the project was an iterative process including research, diagrams, prototyping and design.</p>
          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>Going into the project, I had very little exposure to the technology I would be using. I had to learn about GPIO pins, Python, PHP, and HTML languages as well as how to use project  management tools such as Git and Trello.</p>
          <h3>Diagrams</h3>
          <p>Instead of going straight from research to design, I created diagrams such as the ones below in order to keep myself organized. Diagrams helped to simplify the design process because I had everything that I would designing laid out.</p>
          <img src = "Images/Diagram.jpg">
          <p>This diagram shows how each unique user would interact with the scanners.</p>
          <h3>Prototyping</h3>
          <p>I made prototypes for each part of the project instead of going straight to designing. Prototypes helped me work out errors that would have been problematic if I had started designing without catchign them. During this stage, I used breadboards to wire modules into the Pi's due to the ease of access to the pins. I also used Git in order to prototype the website and code in order to make sure I always had a folder with code that I know worked.</p>
          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>Designing the project was where I learned the most. Through trial and error, I learned how GPIO pins work and how I can manipulate computer languages to my liking. After the modules were wired to the pi without the breadboard, I integrated the code. The logic behind the Pi scanner is written in Python, I had to manipulate this code to send data to a remote database which was used for the website. The website was written with HTML, CSS, and PHP.</p>
